## Description

This project builds a dictionary web app using the prompt and figma design files provided by Frontend Mentor. The challenge of this project is to build a dictionary web app using the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and get it looking as close to the design as possible. While I was building my project using the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/), I had problems connecting to the server, and there were issues such as mispellings or missing words noted in the issues section of their Github, the person who created it did so at a time where they could not find many free dictionary API's and it has been a great free resource for many people, but due to not being sure when these errors would get fixed, and when the server connection would be repaired, I chose to switch to the [Merriam Webster Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/) because I figured it would be kept up to date and maintained more overtime. For the project, Frontend Mentor provides the design files with either Figma or Sketch, starter code, which includes plain text and any assests such as optimized images or font files in an assets folder, the images are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized, and the prompt which explains what features the project should have. You are free to use whatever tools you would like to build the project.

### Features

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup <br>
- CSS custom properties <br>
- Flexbox<br>
- CSS Grid<br>
- Mobile-first workflow<br>
- JavaScript-ES6<br>
- [Webpack Bundler](https://webpack.js.org/)<br>
- [Prettier Code Formatter VS Extension](https://prettier.io/)<br>

### What I learned

I learned how to use the font-face CSS property to work with variable and static fonts and how to use woff/woff2 files for fonts, and static font files as fallbacks. I also learned to connect to an API using the Fetch API, an API key and JSON code, and how to display that information using JSON, and the JavaScript DOM API.
